# Pushup app (Work in progress)
Stores your progresses in physicals exercises, like pushups, on a local database.

This application is being developed using __Linux__ (Mint 17), but it should be portable (I haven't tried yet)

# Requirements
- __Python__ _2.7.8_ : Installed by default on most Linux distros
- __PySide__ _1.2.1_: For _apt-based_ Linux distros, open your terminal and run

```sudo apt-get install python-pyside```

 Otherwise look at the official documentation: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide#installation

- __PyQtGraph__ _0.9.8_: http://www.pyqtgraph.org/

# Development
- __Programming language__ : Python 2.7.6
- __Database__ : Sqlite3
- __GUI__ : Pyside 1.2.1 (Qt 4.8)
- MVC pattern : Unfortunately, the code is not clean because this is my first Python application, and I never used a GUI toolkit like Qt.

# Todo
- View classes. The GUI needs to be completed.
